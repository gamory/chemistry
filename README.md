This is a book I am working on as I study chemistry.  It's completely free to download, and feel free to modify it as you wish.

Obviously I absolve myself of any legal concerns on this sort of information.  I don't believe anything in there is illgal, but some of it is certainly dangerous to use.  You have been warned.

Provided in LaTeX format, and in it's compiled PDF form for convenience.
